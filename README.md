# odin-recipes

This is a project that will showcase my HTML skills through a minimally guided tutorial.

I am going to develop html boilerplates and through the use of the elements, tags and attributes
I have learn so far including <a>, <h...> <href> and <img src> I will create a 
navigateable website for three seperate recipes.
